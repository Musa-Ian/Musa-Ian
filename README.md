## üöÄ About Me

I'm a multi-talented professional who bridges the gap between creative design and technical implementation. With extensive experience in both frontend and backend development, I specialize in building large-scale applications that prioritize user experience and technical excellence.

When I'm not coding, you can find me performing music as **Fristy Ice** üéµ or working as an Aircraft Structural Technician ‚úàÔ∏è ‚Äî bringing a unique blend of creative, technical, and analytical skills to everything I do.
